If you want to commit filename changes that are only about changing the capitalization, you'll need the `git mv` command.

Let's say you have a file called `MyawesomeComponent.js` and want to change it to `MyAwesomeComponent.js` you would need to run

```bash
git mv MyawesomeComponent.js MyAwesomeComponent.js
```

before commiting your changes.
